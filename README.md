# event-counter

Tracks key presses and mouse inputs, displaying the count in a minimal UI.
The count resets upon starting a new game in Mirror's Edge.

## Requirements

- For Windows machines

## Installation

Download and run the `blaj.exe` file from the latest
[Releases](https://github.com/SeungKang/blaj/releases).

You may need to set an exclusion for the exe file, or else Windows
Defender will probably flag and delete it. Refer to the
[Windows documentation][windows-exclusion] for more information.
